# Mouse-Based-Metrics

This is an active authentication component meant to validate a users identity based on their mouse movements.
The mouse movements we utilize will not be posted on Github; however, this repository will demonstrate our implementation of a biometric technique known as Angle Based Metrics (later enhanced by genetic and evolutionary computation techniques).
